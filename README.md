## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher**: The project is configured to use Java 17.
* **Apache Maven**: Used for building and managing the project.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/nrzty/music-player.git](https://github.com/nrzty/music-player.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd music-player
    ```
3.  **Build the project and install dependencies:**
    ```bash mvn clean install ```

### Running the Application

Once the project is built, you can run the application using the following command:

```bash
mvn exec:java
```

## âš™Configuration

The application loads your music from a directory specified in a `config.properties` file.

1.  Create a `config.properties` file in the `src/main/resources` directory.
2.  Add the following line to the file, replacing `/path/to/your/music` with the actual path to your music folder:

    ```properties
    playlist.base.path=/path/to/your/music
    ```

    You can also use `${user.home}` as a placeholder for your home directory. For example:

    ```properties
    playlist.base.path=${user.home}/Music
    ```

If the `config.properties` file is not found, the application will default to `~/MusicPlayerData/songs/`.
